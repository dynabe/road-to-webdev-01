# road-to-webdev-01
Why in Polish language? Because it's only for me.
This project represents my webDev skills. 
Its something like wall on Facebook. Some year earlier you post on Fb wall photos and text that you don't believe that happens. When you see it you think how much IQ did you have at this time. I know my English language it's not perfect but i know this and i try to exercise it.
